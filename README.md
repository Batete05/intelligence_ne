ðŸš— Intelligent Parking System with License Plate Recognition


This is a smart parking system that uses a camera, YOLOv8 object detection, and OCR (Tesseract) to detect and recognize vehicle license plates. When a valid plate is detected, the system logs the entry, saves the plate image, and automatically opens the gate using an Arduino.
